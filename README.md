This project is based on a data set which was used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition( KDD-99).
The task was to try dealing with the Cyber Security challenge by building a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between “bad” connections, called intrusions or attacks, and “good” normal connections.
